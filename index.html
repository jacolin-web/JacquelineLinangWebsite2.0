      <h1>Jacqueline Linang</h1>
      Jacqueline is currently a third year undergraduate student with an A.S. in Computer Science and is currently pursuing a B.S. in Information Systems, with a specialization of Digital Media, at Stony Brook University. Although she has plenty of knowledge in software development and project management she is mainly focused on working with web design and development after graduate, which means she is focused working in front-end, back-end or full-stack development. She is also interested on working with UI/UX and graphic design. Besides school and work, she enjoys going gallery hopping, having photoshoots, going to hackathons, and overall she enjoys working with different people on new ideas and projects that benefit and bring people together.
